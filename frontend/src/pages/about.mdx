## Hi, I’m <RandomColor>Dave</RandomColor> 👋

I help businesses automate workflows & spreadsheets, build reliable dashboards, and turn messy data into clear, usable insights.

Most of my work focuses on reducing manual effort, improving reporting accuracy, and helping teams make better decisions with the data they already have.

- **Excel & VBA automation**  
  Streamlining repetitive workflows and complex reporting models.

- **Google Sheets & Apps Script**  
  Building connected, automated spreadsheets that update themselves.

- **Power BI & Looker Studio dashboards**  
  Clear, decision-focused, brand-aligned dashboards for operations, finance, and marketing.

- **Python & R scripting**  
  Data cleaning, transformation, modeling, analytics and automation pipelines.

- **Custom data visualizations**  
  Interactive charts using D3.js(with Svelte, React) for storytelling/ scrollytelling.

## How I work

I start by understanding the business problem, not just the data.

My focus is on:
- clarity over complexity  
- solutions that are easy to maintain  
- documentation so you’re not locked in  

I prefer building <RandomColor>simple, robust systems</RandomColor> that continue to work long after delivery.

## Who I work with

I typically work with:
- founders and small teams
- operations, finance, and marketing teams
- businesses that rely heavily on spreadsheets and reports

If your data feels fragile, slow, or hard to trust — that’s usually a good fit.
