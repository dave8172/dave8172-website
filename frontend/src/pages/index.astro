    <p>
      I have experience in building end-to-end data systems transforming fragmented workflows 
	  and messy data into automated, brand-aligned visual dashboards and interactive charts.

    <h2>What I do</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Excel & VBA automation</strong> — faster reporting, fewer errors</li>
      <li><strong>Google Sheets & Apps Script</strong> — connected, automated workflows</li>
      <li><strong>Power BI & Looker Studio</strong> — decision-ready dashboards</li>
      <li><strong>Python & R scripting</strong> — data cleaning, automation and modeling</li>
      <li><strong>Custom visualizations</strong> — D3.js, Svelte for data-storytelling and scrollytelling</li>
      <li><strong>Web Development</strong> — Astro, React, Svelte with Vercel for clean web apps and front-end</li>
    </ul>

	<!-- <p>
      Take a look at some of the common problem statements I have solved:
    </p>

    
	<ul style = "list-style-type: '+ ';">
		<li><strong>Make sense of data from multiple sources</strong> - I can integrate data from multiple sources into powerful and simple dashboards or sheets and tables, 
			to gain insights from multiple channels, and have a single source of truth systems.</li>
		<li><strong>Streamline data processes to structure and clean data</strong> - Often, data entry or collection can have inconsistencies, generating confusion. 
			I can help with automating data flows so that final data is structured and normalized, be it Excel or Google Sheets, having expertise in VBA and Apps Script.</li>
		<li><strong>Build clean dashboards to drive business decisions</strong> - I design and build clean and powerful dashboards 
			in PowerBI and Looker Studio, so that KPIs and important metrics can be monitored easily. It includes including marketing analytics, operations, sales, inventory forecasting, etc.
			As dashboards are as powerful as backend, I like to implement end-to-end data systems, which are scalable and robust.</li>
		<li><strong>Excel/ Google Sheets calculators, planners and automated tools</strong> - Having expertise in advanced VBA coding and Google Apps Script, I can build complex calculators in Excel and 
			Google Sheets, to increase efficiency, automate workflows and get real-time data views.</li>
	</ul> -->

    <h2>How I work</h2>

    <p>
      I focus on understanding the problem first, then building clean,
      maintainable solutions that clients can actually use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of my work comes from real business needs — reporting bottlenecks,
      messy spreadsheets, and dashboards that don’t answer the right questions.
    </p>
	
	<p>
	 My Ethos: <RandomColor>Respect. Integrity. Simplicity.</RandomColor>
	 I prioritize clear communication to build sustainable long term relationships and collaborations
