## Overview
I specialize in building custom <RandomColor>Python scripts</RandomColor> that don't just "dump" text, but replicate the exact layout and structure of your 
source files into clean, professional Excel workbooks.

## Python Libraries & Tools

- <RandomColor>pdfplumber:</RandomColor> For high-precision extraction of metadata, headers, and positioned text (non-OCR).

- <RandomColor>Camelot (Lattice & Stream):</RandomColor> For complex table extraction. Camelot is industry-leading for detecting table structures, borders, 
and multi-line cell data that standard tools miss.

- <RandomColor>pytesseract (OCR):</RandomColor> To handle non-digital, scanned, or image-based PDFs. I use Tesseract to convert "unreadable" scans into searchable 
data, ensuring no invoice is left unprocessed.

- <RandomColor>Openpyxl:</RandomColor> To programmatically build your Excel template, including merged cells, custom borders, shaded headers, and A4 
print-ready formatting.

## Use Cases

- **Template Replication:** <RandomColor>Replicate your PDF’s</RandomColor> layout in Excel, ensuring that the "To" address, Invoice details, and 
Product tables land exactly where they should.

- **Clean Data Extraction:** No more "ghost" characters or misaligned columns. Multi-line descriptions and complex "Totals" 
sections are handled with ease.

- **Summary Sheets:** Automated "Summary" tabs that pull key data points (like Invoice Totals and Company Names) from 
hundreds of PDFs into a single <RandomColor>master list</RandomColor>.

- **Custom Logic:** Can be customised for specific formatting, such as auto-resizing columns, currency formatting, and bolded totals.
